                <h1>Game Design</h1>
                <h2>Game Overview</h2>
                <p>A 'Space Shooter' Game from the action genre, targeted for all ages developed as a 'Web Game' using a simple code editor and some knowledge of the web-based coding languages.</p>
                <h2>Game Concept</h2>
                <p>The idea first occured to me when I played an old game called 'Space Invaders' it was a simple game with a simple idea behind it, combined with my love to the shooter games sub-genre I decided to make my own.</p>
                <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                <p>The gameplay is very simple you spawn in the space with your trusty space ship, surronded by aliens you try to work your throw the universe trying to get back home to Earth. But Wait 'Who told you it was gonna be easy?'.</p>
                <h2>Game Interface Design</h2>
                <p>The general UI is simple the key "A" will move the player to the left, the key "D" will move the player to the right the key "J" will shoot missiles to destroy your enemies.</p>
                <h2>Game Enviroment & Level Design</h2>
                <p>Obviously the levels of the game are made in space, But this is just the tip of the iceberg, if you have ever played a game or watched any movie like 'Star Wars', 'Star Trek', etc... you may now see what I aim for for this project the far space filled with nothing but enemies you wish to eat you for dinner.</p>

                <h1 class="h1">Game Implementation</h1>
                <h2>Game Features</h2>
                <p>Your equipped with a missile launcher to shoot your enemies, constantly fighting enemies in space each have their own power and different attack type with a couple of power-ups around the game scenes for you to grab to increase your chance of winning which by winning I mean returning "Home"</p>
                <h2>Gameplay & Player Mechanics</h2>
                <p>Collecting coins, Gathering power-ups, Defeating all enemies in your way are the key features of the game.</p>
