                    <div class="p">The agile development methodology was employed for this project. This allows for more flexible production, as this utilises more frequent iteration of design and development procedures. As such the project design and prototypes were developed in tandem, with frequent meetings of team members throughout to establish timelines and specifications for project milestones.
                    This required all team members to communicate effectively and efficiently throughout. As such Discord was used to allow voice chat, text messaging and screen sharing for the purposes of development meetings and implementation sessions.
